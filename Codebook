## `run_analysis.R` Script Explanation

The `run_analysis.R` script performs data cleaning as follows:

1. **Loading the data into the following variables:**
   - `activity_name` (6 rows, 2 columns): Description of activities and their codes
   - `x_label` (561 rows, 2 columns): Variable names for features collected from accelerometer and gyroscope
   - `subject_test` (2947 rows, 1 column): ID of test subjects
   - `subject_train` (7352 rows, 1 column): ID of train subjects
   - `x_test` (2947 rows, 561 columns): Test data for `x_label`
   - `x_train` (7352 rows, 561 columns): Train data for `x_label`
   - `y_test` (2947 rows, 1 column): Test data of activity using code labels (1 to 6)
   - `y_train` (7352 rows, 1 column): Train data of activity using code labels (1 to 6)

2. **Changing Variable Names**
   - Change variable names to enhance their understandability after set merging
   - Rename the 'x_test' and 'x_train' variables to 'x_label'
   - Rename the 'y_test' and 'y_train' variables to 'activity'
   - Rename the 'subject_test' and 'subject_train' variables to 'test' and 'train' respectively

3. **Changing Variable Types (Converting the 'activity' variable into a factor variable with understandable labels)**
   - `x_train$activity`, `y_train$activity`: Factor with 6 labels (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

4. **Extracting Specified Variables**
   - `x_test` (2947 rows, 561 columns) -> `x_test2` (2947 rows, 66 columns)
   - `x_train` (7352 rows, 561 columns) -> `x_train2` (7352 rows, 66 columns)

5. **Merging Training and Test Data into a Single Set, and Adding an Additional Variable to Differentiate Between Them**
   - `merged_train` (7352 rows, 68 columns): Merging `subject_train`, `x_train2`, `y_train`
   - `merged_test` (7352 rows, 68 columns): Merging `subject_test`, `x_test2`, `y_test`
   - `first_set` (10299 rows, 69 columns): Merging `merged_train`, `merged_test`, and adding an additional variable (`set`, value: train, test)

6. **Making Variable Names Understandable**
   - Change `t` to `time` and `f` to `frequency`
   - Change `Acc` to `accelerometer` and `Gyro` to `gyroscope`
   - Change `-` to `_`
   - Lowercase names and insert `_` to separate words

7. **Summarizing Data Using Means Grouped by Subjects and Activities**
   - Create `second_set` to summarize `first_set` using means grouped by subjects and activities

8. **Saving Data**
   - Save `first_set` as "1st_data.txt": Merging test and train data set which only contains `std()` and `mean()`
   - Save `second_set` as "2nd_data.txt": Summarized first data set
